# simdutf8-portable â€“ Fast UTF-8 validation using `core::simd` (portable SIMD)

Fast API-compatible UTF-8 validation for Rust using the experimental architecture-independan
[`core::simd`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/simd/index.html) (portable SIMD) module from the
standard library. An up-to-date nightly Rust compiler is required. The API and the algorithm used
are the same as in the [simdutf8](https://crates.io/crates/simdutf8) crate.

## Features

- `#[forbid(unsafe_code)]` implementation
- `auto` module which selects the best implementation for known-good targets at compile-time
  including falling back to a scalar implementation if a fast SIMD implementation is not possible.
- Future-proof: The implementation is designed to be future-proof and will be updated as the
  `core::simd` module evolves
- `no_std` support
- no unnecessary bounds checks in the compiled code (as of nightly-xx)
- fast out of the box for `aarch64` and `wasm32` targets
- Features to force a specific implementation at compile-time
- Support 128-bit and 256-bit SIMD

## Limitations

- target-feature
- no runtime implementation selection
- slower
  - memcpy calls
- swizzle_dyn
  - slow on uncommon targets
  - requires -Zbuild-std for sse4.2, avx2 support if not part of the target architecture

## Quick start

Add the dependency to your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[dependencies]
simdutf8-portable = "0.01"
```

Use `simdutf8-portable::basic::from_utf8()` as a drop-in replacement for `std::str::from_utf8()`.

```rust
use simdutf8-portable::basic::from_utf8;

println!("{}", from_utf8(b"I \xE2\x9D\xA4\xEF\xB8\x8F UTF-8!").unwrap());
```

If you need detailed information on validation failures, use `simdutf8::compat::from_utf8()`
instead.

```rust
use simdutf8-portable::compat::from_utf8;

let err = from_utf8(b"I \xE2\x9D\xA4\xEF\xB8 UTF-8!").unwrap_err();
assert_eq!(err.valid_up_to(), 5);
assert_eq!(err.error_len(), Some(2));
```

## APIs

See docs or [simdutf8](https://crates.io/crates/simdutf8).

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

Rust nightly as of xx xx

## Architecture notes

## Benchmarks

## Thanks

- to [Heinz N. Gies](https://github.com/licenser) for the initial portable SIMD implementation.
- to the authors of simdjson for coming up with the high-performance SIMD implementation and in
  particular to Daniel Lemire for his feedback. It was very helpful.
- to the authors of the simdjson Rust port who did most of the heavy lifting of porting the C++ code
  to Rust.
