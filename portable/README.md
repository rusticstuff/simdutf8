# simdutf8-portable â€“ Fast UTF-8 validation using `core::simd` (portable SIMD)

Fast API-compatible UTF-8 validation for Rust using the experimental
[`core::simd`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/simd/index.html) (portable SIMD) module from the
standard library. An up-to-date nightly Rust compiler is required. The API and the algorithm are the
same as in the [simdutf8](https://crates.io/crates/simdutf8) crate.

## Features

- no unsafe code (`#[forbid(unsafe_code)]`) in the implementation
- good performance (with **caveats**, see [architecture notes](#Architecture-notes))
- `auto` module which selects the best implementation for known-good targets at compile-time
  including falling back to `core::str:from_utf8`.
- new platforms need no new code as long as they are supported by `core::simd`
- `no_std` support
- supports 128-bit and 256-bit SIMD

## Limitations

The functions in `core::simd` are marked as `#[inline]`. This way they are compiled to MIR  Code generation is deferred until they are actually used in a crate.
- target-feature required
- no runtime implementation selection
- slower
  - memcpy calls
- swizzle_dyn
  - slow on non-special-cased targets
  - requires -Zbuild-std for sse4.2, avx2 support if not part of the target architecture

## Performance

- There are no unnecessary bounds checks in the compiled code, functions are properly inlined and
  loops properly unrolled (as of nightly-xx).
- uses memcpy because of forbid(unsafe), see https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/87440
- swizzle_dyn slower because of abstraction

\*) using `basic::from_utf8`

## Quick start

Add the dependency to your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[dependencies]
simdutf8-portable = "0.0.1"
```

Use `simdutf8-portable::basic::from_utf8()` as a drop-in replacement for `std::str::from_utf8()`.

```rust
use simdutf8-portable::basic::from_utf8;

println!("{}", from_utf8(b"I \xE2\x9D\xA4\xEF\xB8\x8F UTF-8!").unwrap());
```

If you need detailed information on validation failures, use `simdutf8::compat::from_utf8()`
instead.

```rust
use simdutf8-portable::compat::from_utf8;

let err = from_utf8(b"I \xE2\x9D\xA4\xEF\xB8 UTF-8!").unwrap_err();
assert_eq!(err.valid_up_to(), 5);
assert_eq!(err.error_len(), Some(2));
```

## APIs

See docs or [simdutf8](https://crates.io/crates/simdutf8).

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

Rust nightly as of xx xx
