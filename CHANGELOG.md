# Changelog
## [Unreleased]

### Bug fixes
* Fix Undefined Behavior in WebAssembly SIMD128 (#86) (thanks @CryZe)
* Documentation and clippy fixes (thanks @rtfeldman, @jqnatividad, @rhysd)

### Performance
* WASM: Don't use u8x16_bitmask for ASCII Check (#79) (thanks @CryZe)

## [0.1.4] - 2022-04-02

### New features
* WASM (wasm32) support

### Improvements
* Make aarch64 SIMD implementation work on Rust 1.59/1.60 with create feature `aarch64_neon`
* For Rust Nightly the aarch64 SIMD implementation is enabled out of the box.
* Starting with Rust 1.61 the aarch64 SIMD implementation is expected to be enabled out of the box as well.

### Performance
* Prefetch was disabled for aarch64 since the requisite intrinsics have not been stabilized.

## [0.1.3] - 2021-05-14
### New features
* Low-level streaming validation API in `simdutf8::basic::imp`

## [0.1.2] - 2021-05-09
### New features
* Aarch64 support (e.g. Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi 4, ...) with nightly Rust and crate feature `aarch64_neon`

### Performance
* Another speedup on pure ASCII data
* Aligned reads have been removed as the performance was worse overall.
* Prefetch is used selectively on AVX 2, where it provides a slight benefit on some Intel CPUs.

### Other
* Refactored SIMD integration to allow easy implementation for new architectures
* Full test coverage
* Thoroughly fuzz-tested

## [0.1.1] - 2021-04-26
### Performance
* Large speedup on small inputs from delegation to std lib
* Up to 50% better peak throughput on ASCII
* `#[inline]` main entry points for a small general speedup.

### Other
* Make both Utf8Error variants implement `std::error::Error`
* Make `basic::Utf8Error` implement `core::fmt::Display`
* Document Minimum Supported Rust Version (1.38.0).
* Reduce package size.
* Documentation updates
