//! The `basic` API flavor provides barebones UTF-8 checking at the highest speed.
//!
//! It is fastest on valid UTF-8, but only checks for errors after processing the whole byte sequence
//! and does not provide detailed information if the data is not valid UTF-8. [`Utf8Error`] is a zero-sized error struct.
//!
//! If you need detailed error information use the functions from the [`crate::compat`] module instead.
